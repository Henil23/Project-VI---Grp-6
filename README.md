A project intended to re/create a portal where students from universities from Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge, and Guelph apply to degree-level jobs at a one stop destination.
Job posting is limited to start-ups, where student can directly connect with the person who they will be working with, completely eliminating the need to talk with the HRs.

Portal creation is done in ASP.NET 8 and its major focus is to test it's efficiency and overall performance using tools like JMeter to make it deployable in span of 4 weeks.
